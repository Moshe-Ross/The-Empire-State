    <h1>New York City</h1>

    <p> New York City is by far the largest city in the United States, with an estimated 2016 population of 8.55 million. Since
      the first US census in 1790, it has held that position, and continues to have more than double the population of Los
      Angeles, the second largest city. Chicago is the third largest city in the US, but has just 1/3 the number of people
      as New York City. New York City continues to have major influence and impact on the world’s economy, entertainment, media,
      education, art, technology, and scientific research. The city features five separate boroughs:) Staten Island, The Bronx,
      Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan. As many as 800 languages are spoken throughout New York City, making it the most diverse
      city in the world when it comes to linguistic multiplicity.
    </p>

    <p>The estimated population for New York City in 2016 is 8,550,405. This reflects growth of 375,300 people, a 4.6% increase,
      since the 2010 census recorded 8.175 million residents.
    </p>

    <p>The largest increase in New York City’s population occurred in the borough of Brooklyn, which showed a population increase
      of 5.3% between the 2010 census and 2016 estimates. The second largest change is in the Bronx, which reflected a 5.1%
      increase, followed by Queens (4.9%), Manhattan (3.7%) and Staten Island (1.2%).
    </p>

    <h2>New York City Life Expectancy</h2>

    <p>The latest research shows that people who live in New York City have a higher life expectancy than the rest of the country.
      In 2010, the life expectancy of a person living in New York City was 80.9 years of age. This is 2.2 years longer than
      the life expectancy of the entire country, which is 78.7 years of age. That increase in life expectancy is actually 2
      percent higher than the previous year (2009). This research was completed by New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg
      and the city’s Department of Health.
    </p>

    <h2>New York City's Population Projections</h2>

    <p>New York City's population is expected to reach 9 million by 2040, based on recent projections created by the city. Among
      the 5 boroughs, the Bronx's growth is projected to be the highest at 14% between 2010 and 2040. On the flip side, Manhattan
      is expected to grow by 6.7% by 2040.
    </p>

    <p>If these projections are accurate, Brooklyn will extend its lead over Queens as the largest borough in New York City, growing
      to nearly 3 million by 2040.

  <h1>Long Island</h1>

  <p>Long Island is an island in New York that reaches from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean. Long Island is actually comprised
  of 4 counties, including 2 that form New York City boroughs Queens and Brooklyn. While all 4 counties are part of the New
  York metropolitan area, the name Long Island generally only refers to Suffolk and Nassau counties.</p>

  <p>Long Island has an estimated population of 7.75 million in 2013. It is the most populated island in any U.S. territory or
  state and the 17th most populous island in the world, beating Ireland and Jamaica. If Long Island were a state, it would
  by the 13th most populous and first in terms of population density with 5,402 people per square mile, or 2,086 people per
  square kilometer. It is one of the most densely populated regions in the country. Long Island has 39% of the total population
  of the state of New York.</p>

  <p>Suffolk County has twice the area of Nassau County but it is much more densely populated. When the population of all 4 counties
  are combined, Long Island has a population greater than 38 states in the country. If it were a country, it would by the 96th
  most populated ahead of Israel.</p>

  <p>Long Island is also the largest and longest island in the contiguous U.S, stretching 118 miles east from New York Harbor
  with a land area of 1,401 square miles. It is also home to LaGuardia Airport and JFK International Airport in Queens.
  </p>

  <h2>Long Island Demographics</h2>

  <p>Whites are the largest racial group in Long Island and form a majority in Suffolk and Nassau counties. A 2002 study by nonprofit
  ERASE Racism found that these two counties are the most racially segregated suburbs in the country.
  </p>

  <p>The largest religious group in the area is Catholic at 52%, followed by Jewish (16%) and Protestant (7%).</p>

  <p>Long Island is home to a large Italian-American community with 26% of residents claiming Italian ancestry. There is also
  a fairly new Little India community in Nassau County. Chinatowns in Brooklyn and Queens have also led to a growing Asian
  population in Nassau County. There is also a Long Island Koreatown.
  </p>

  <h2>Long Island Facts</h2>

  <p>The Native American name for Long Island is Paumonauk, meaning "fish-shaped island."</p>

  <h1>Study: Nassau County has highest taxes in the nation</h1>

  <p>A recent study has revealed that Nassau County has the highest taxes in the nation.</p>

  <p>The study done by the Tax Foundation found that the median Nassau taxpayer shells out about $8,400 a year in property taxes.</p>

  <p>Suffolk County is 12th on the list with the average taxpayer shelling out about $7,000.</p>

  <p>Officials say the amount is so high because the biggest factor is school taxes.</p>
